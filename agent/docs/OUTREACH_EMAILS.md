Subject: Quick question about insurance paperwork

Hey {{first_name}},  
Contractor paperwork (COIs, WSIB, licenses) is a time suck — and expiries create real liability. I built a small Jobber add‑on that **collects COIs from subs, reads the dates/limits automatically, and reminds them before expiry**. Could we pilot it with your crew next month?
