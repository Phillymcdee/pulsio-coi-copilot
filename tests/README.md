## Testing Approach

### 1. Manual Testing (Current Phase)
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: End-to-end user workflow validation
- **Exploratory Testing**: Ad-hoc testing to discover edge cases
- **Usability Testing**: UX validation and improvement

### 2. Automated Testing (Future Phase)
- **Unit Tests**: Component and service-level testing
- **Integration Tests**: API and database interaction testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Browser automation with Playwright/Cypress

### 3. Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: Document upload and processing under load
- **API Performance**: Response time validation
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization validation

## Current Testing Status

✅ **Core User Workflow Tested** (July 29, 2025)
- Authentication flow validated
- Onboarding wizard complete
- QuickBooks integration initiated
- Dashboard functionality verified

## Best Practices

1. **Document Everything**: Every test case should have clear steps and expected results
2. **Version Control**: All test documents are version controlled
3. **Traceability**: Link test cases to requirements and user stories
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Update test cases based on findings
5. **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus on high-risk, high-value features first

## Getting Started

1. Review test plans in `test-plans/`
2. Execute manual tests and document results in `test-reports/manual/`
3. Use `test-data/` for consistent test scenarios
4. Report bugs and improvements in GitHub Issues
