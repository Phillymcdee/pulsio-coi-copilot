```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Pulsio. 

I'm calling contractors who use QuickBooks to see if they're capturing all their early payment discounts, or if they're losing money while chasing vendors for W-9s and insurance certificates.

Do you currently track vendor compliance manually, or do you have an automated system?

[LISTEN]

The reason I'm calling is we helped [Similar Company] capture $12,000 in early payment discounts they were missing due to manual document collection. 

Would it be worth 10 minutes to show you how they did it?"
