## Demo Script Structure (15 minutes total)

### Opening (2 minutes)
**Goal**: Set agenda, confirm pain points, create urgency

```
"Hi [Name], great to meet you! I have exactly 15 minutes to show you how [Similar Company] went from manually chasing vendors for documents to capturing $12,000 in early payment discounts they were missing.

Before we dive in, let me confirm what you mentioned about [Company]:
• You're currently using QuickBooks for vendor management
• You have approximately [X] vendors you pay regularly  
• You're spending [X] hours monthly on document collection
• You've had issues with missing W-9s or insurance certificates

Is that accurate? And what's the biggest frustration with your current process?"

[LISTEN - Let them talk for 30-45 seconds]

"Perfect. Let me show you exactly how we solved those exact issues for contractors just like you."
```

### Problem Agitation (1 minute)
**Goal**: Quantify their pain using industry data

```
"Before we look at the solution, let me show you something that might shock you.

[Share screen - ROI Calculator]

Based on what you told me about [Company]:
• $[X] monthly vendor payments
• That means you have $[Y] in early payment discount opportunities annually
• If you're missing even 30% of those discounts due to manual processes...
• You're losing $[Z] every year

And that doesn't include:
• IRS penalties for incorrect 1099s - $330 each
• Staff time - 6 hours monthly at $25/hour = $1,800 annually
• Late payment fees when discounts expire

Does this match what you're experiencing at [Company]?"
```

### Solution Demo (8 minutes)
**Goal**: Show the automated system solving their exact problems

#### Step 1: QuickBooks Integration (2 minutes)
```
"Let me show you how this works. This is a live Pulsio dashboard connected to QuickBooks.

[Show Dashboard]

See how we automatically pulled all 22 vendors from QuickBooks? No manual data entry required.

The system knows:
• Which vendors are 1099 contractors requiring W-9s
• Who needs current insurance certificates  
• Payment schedules and discount deadlines
• Missing document status for each vendor

This took zero setup time - just a one-click QuickBooks connection."
```

#### Step 2: Real-Time Compliance Monitoring (2 minutes)  
```
"Now look at this compliance dashboard. This is what you'd see every morning:

[Point to key metrics]
• 36% compliance rate - that means 64% of vendors are missing documents
• $1,318 per month at risk - that's $15,816 annually in missed discounts
• 18 specific missing documents listed with deadlines

Instead of digging through spreadsheets or email folders, you get instant visibility into exactly what's missing and when you need it."
```

#### Step 3: Automated Reminder System (2 minutes)
```
"Here's where the magic happens. Watch what the system does automatically:

[Show Reminder System]

For each missing document, the system:
• Sends professional branded emails to vendors
• Includes secure upload links - no email attachments
• Follows up automatically on your schedule
• Sends SMS reminders for urgent items
• Escalates to you only if vendors don't respond

This vendor here got 3 professional reminders over 10 days. No work from your team."
```

#### Step 4: Results and ROI (2 minutes)
```
"And here's what happens when documents come in:

[Show Timeline/Activity Feed]

• Real-time notifications when vendors upload documents
• Automatic compliance verification
• Instant payment eligibility updates
• Early discount deadline alerts

[Company Name similar to theirs] went from 40% to 95% compliance in 90 days.
That turned $15,000 in missed discounts into $13,500 captured - every year.

ROI of 575% in the first year, plus their office manager got 6 hours per month back."
```

### Value Proposition Summary (2 minutes)
**Goal**: Tie demo back to their specific situation

```
"So for [Company], here's what this means:

[Personalize based on their numbers]
• Stop losing $[X] annually in missed early payment discounts
• Reduce admin time from [X] hours to under 1 hour monthly  
• Eliminate risk of IRS penalties from missing W-9s
• Get real-time visibility into vendor compliance status
• Professional vendor communication that strengthens relationships

The Pro plan at $197/month pays for itself if you capture just one $200 discount monthly.

Based on your [X] vendor count, I'd estimate $[Y] in annual savings - does that sound realistic for [Company]?"
```

### Close and Next Steps (2 minutes)
**Goal**: Get commitment to move forward

```
"[Name], I can see this solving exactly the problems you described. 

The good news is we can have you up and running in under 10 minutes:
• Connect your QuickBooks - 2 minutes
• Configure reminder preferences - 3 minutes  
• Send first reminders - automated within 5 minutes

We offer a 14-day free trial with no credit card required. You'll see real results with your actual vendors and can measure the exact discount capture improvement.

[PAUSE - Let them respond]

Based on response:
• If Yes: "Perfect, let me send you the setup link right now"
• If Need to Think: "What questions can I answer to help with your decision?"
• If Need Approval: "Who else would be involved in this decision? Happy to present to them as well."
```

## Common Objections and Responses

### "We don't have that many vendors"
```
"I understand. Even with 10-15 vendors, if you're missing 2-3 early payment discounts per month at $100-200 each, that's $2,400-7,200 annually. The system pays for itself with just one missed discount per month. 

Plus, as you grow, the savings compound. Would you like to see the ROI calculator with your specific numbers?"
```

### "Our process works fine currently"  
```
"That's great that you have a process in place. Let me ask - when was the last time you calculated how much you're capturing in early payment discounts versus how much is available?

Most contractors are surprised to learn they're only capturing 40-60% of available discounts due to timing and manual processes. Even if your process works 80% of the time, that 20% could be costing $3,000-5,000 annually."
```

### "We need to check our budget"
```
"I completely understand budget considerations. Here's the thing - this actually pays for itself from the first month through captured discounts you're currently missing.

The Pro plan is $197/month. If it helps you capture just one extra $200 early payment discount monthly, it's cash flow positive immediately. Based on your vendor volume, I'd expect 3-5 additional discounts captured monthly.

Would a 14-day free trial help prove the ROI before any budget commitment?"
```

### "We need to discuss with our team"
```
"Absolutely, this affects your whole accounts payable process. Who else would be involved in evaluating this?

I'm happy to present to your team and show them exactly how it would work with your QuickBooks data. I could also set up the free trial so your team can see real results before making a decision.

Would next Tuesday or Wednesday work better for a team demo?"
```

### "What about QuickBooks integration reliability?"
```
"Great question. We're QuickBooks certified partners with enterprise-grade integration. The connection is read-only for security, and we sync with your existing vendor data without changing anything in QuickBooks.

Over 500+ contractors are using this integration daily without issues. We also provide full technical support during setup and ongoing use.

Would seeing the integration process help address any specific concerns?"
```
