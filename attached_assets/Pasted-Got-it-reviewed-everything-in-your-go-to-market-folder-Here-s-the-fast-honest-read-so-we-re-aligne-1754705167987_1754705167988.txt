Got it—reviewed everything in your go-to-market folder. Here’s the fast, honest read so we’re aligned on context.

What you’re building (in one line)

Pulsio automates vendor document collection for SMB contractors using QuickBooks Online—W‑9s, COIs, reminders—then ties it to cash impact (capturing early‑payment discounts / avoiding penalties) to justify ROI.

ICP & buying context (from your assets)
	•	Who: Small–mid general contractors (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roofing, landscaping), ~10–100 vendors, QBO Plus/Advanced, recurring vendor payments.
	•	Buyer/users: Owner, office manager, AP clerk/bookkeeper, sometimes the ProAdvisor.
	•	Core pains: Spreadsheet chaos, email chasing, missed discounts, IRS/1099 exposure, COI expiry blind spots.
	•	Primary promise: “Turn compliance from an admin sinkhole into cash saved and risk removed.”

What’s strong (nice work)
	•	Clear ICP & workflow focus on QBO.
	•	ROI-first narrative (e.g., “$1,318/month at risk”) that tees up demo urgency.
	•	Sales demo structure with live metrics (“vendors, compliance %, money at risk”).
	•	Useful lead magnets (compliance checklist, case‑study template) that match the pain.
	•	Execution tracker with weekly cadence and concrete outreach/content actions.

Gaps / risks to tighten
	•	Compliance accuracy: Penalty figures and COI/W‑9 guidance need citations/guardrails + a “not tax/legal advice” disclaimer across content.
	•	Security & trust: You’re touching TIN/PII—need a Security & Compliance page (data handling, encryption, retention, least‑privilege, DPA, SOC2 roadmap).
	•	Competitive positioning: Add a one‑pager vs MyCOI / TrustLayer / Certificial / Tax1099/Track1099 / QBO add‑ons (where you win: QBO‑native simplicity + compliance‑to‑cash outcomes).
	•	Objection handling in the demo script: “We already use email/Sheets,” “Our ProAdvisor handles it,” “We’re on ServiceTitan/Buildertrend,” “We only collect W‑9 once,” “What about QB Desktop?”
	•	Pricing clarity: Not present. Recommend tiered by vendor count + “Starter (≤25 vendors), Growth (≤75), Pro (≤150)” with overage. Add 14‑day trial and ‘ROI or don’t pay’ guarantee for early logos.
	•	Channel angle: ProAdvisor/insurance broker partnerships are mentioned—needs offer, rev‑share %, and collateral (one‑pager + co‑demo deck).
	•	Evidence: Case study template is good—now get one real pilot to populate it (even if discounted) and screenshot hard metrics.
	•	Surface area: Consider adjacent buyers with identical pains (property management, HOAs, facilities maintenance) for later waves.

Quick wins (next 7–10 days)
	1.	Publish: Security & Compliance page + Pricing page (tiers, trial, guarantee, FAQs).
	2.	Outbound: Ship a 3‑touch email + 2 LinkedIn DMs sequence for AP/Office Managers (personalized with “money at risk” calc).
	3.	Demo hardening: Two demo datasets—“messy baseline” and “after Pulsio”—and add 6 crisp objections w/ answers.
	4.	Partner kit: 1‑pager for QB ProAdvisors and insurance brokers (they care about COI compliance) with a clean rev‑share.
	5.	Proof point: Run a 30‑day “100% compliant” pilot with 1–2 GCs; lock a testimonial + metric screenshots for the case study.

File‑level nits I’d fix
	•	Blog & checklist: Add a short legal disclaimer, cite IRS penalty ranges, note ACORD 25 is common but not “standard,” and clarify that COI requirements vary by contract/industry.
	•	Demo script: Insert objection handling, a 30‑second security spiel, and explicit “next step” (trial start + import vendors now).
	•	Prospect list template: Add sources (LinkedIn Sales Navigator, local GC associations, Blue Book, ConstructConnect, QB Find‑a‑ProAdvisor) and a “data enrichment” mini‑checklist (tech, vendor count, billing cadence).
	•	Execution plan/tracker: Add KPIs you’ll actually monitor weekly: #qualified convos, demos booked, trials started, trial→paid conversion, CAC, payback.

If you want, I can take first drafts of:
	•	Pricing page (tiers + FAQs),
	•	Security page (straightforward, credible),
	•	Outbound sequence (email + LinkedIn), and
	•	Competitive one‑pager.

Tell me which two you want done first, and I’ll spin them up.
