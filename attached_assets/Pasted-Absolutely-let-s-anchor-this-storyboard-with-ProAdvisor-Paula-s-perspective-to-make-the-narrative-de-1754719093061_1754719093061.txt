ProAdvisor Paula’s Story: Before & After Pulsio (Mid-Project Vendor Addition)

⸻

Before Pulsio — A Day in Paula’s Shoes

3:00 PM, a Wednesday afternoon
Paula, a trusted ProAdvisor for a mid-sized HVAC contracting client, gets an urgent call. A subcontractor just quit, and the client has hired a new drywall subcontractor at the last minute.

Paula’s pain:
	•	She opens QuickBooks but sees no W‑9 or COI on file for the new sub.
	•	She sends an email and texts the GC to chase the missing W‑9 and COI.
	•	The subcontractor replies late with blurry photos of documents.
	•	Without clear documentation, she holds off finalizing vendor profile—payments stall, client gets frustrated.
	•	Worst of all: she has no dashboard showing lost early‑payment discounts or insurance risk.

Throughout the afternoon, Paula is reactive and stressed—dragged into compliance firefighting mid-project, impacting cash flow and goodwill.

Contextual evidence: GCs are responsible for ensuring subs have proper certifications and records—and failures here result in chaos on-site.  ￼ ￼

After Pulsio — Paula Controls the Workflow

3:00 PM, same day
Paula logs into Pulsio to check vendor status. She spots the new subcontractor automatically flagged as non-compliant—W‑9 and COI missing.

With one click:
	•	Pulsio triggers automated W‑9 and COI requests to the sub.
	•	Reminder emails are queued until documentation arrives.
	•	The vendor responses sync directly back into QBO, updating Paula’s dashboard.
	•	Immediately, she sees the Money at Risk widget turn green—no risk of delay or lost discounts.

Paula replies confidently to the client: “All vendor docs are now in place; payments will proceed smoothly, and your early-payment discount is secure.”

Evidence-backed rationale:
	•	Subcontractor onboarding is critical and repetitive across projects, and lacking it, GCs lose time and risk non-compliance.  ￼
	•	Automating W-9/COI collection upfront prevents duplicate admin and ensures documentation readiness.

Pain Point	Pulsio Fix
Vendor docs chasing mid-project	Automated requests/refill, no manual follow-ups
No visibility on compliance delays	Dashboard flags live missing documents, minimizing surprises
Client relations at risk	Proactive documentation protects client cash & trust
Disjoint compliance & financials	“Money at Risk” ties compliance to real-dollar outcomes

Takeaway

This narrative reframes Pulsio not as a piece of compliance software, but as Paula’s control center—taking her from reactive chaos to proactive confidence, with clarity into tax, legal, and cashflow outcomes.
