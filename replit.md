# Pulsio - Automated Document Collection for Contractors

## Overview

Pulsio is a full-stack web application that automates the collection of subcontractor W-9s and Certificates of Insurance (COIs) for trade-service contractors using QuickBooks Online integration. The system helps contractors capture early-payment discounts, avoid IRS penalties, and reduce administrative overhead by automatically tracking missing documents and sending reminders.

**Current Status:** 95% complete - QuickBooks integration working with real contractor data!
**MVP Achievement:** ✓ Real vendor sync complete - 4 contractors imported with proper W-9/COI tracking
**Ready for Production:** Core workflow functional - document collection system operational.
**See:** `implementation_roadmap.md` for detailed completion plan.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

This is a modern full-stack application built with a **monorepo structure** containing both client and server code:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, built using Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Replit OAuth integration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Real-time Updates**: Server-Sent Events (SSE)

## Key Components

### 1. Authentication & User Management
- **Replit OAuth**: Integrated authentication using Replit's OIDC
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **User Storage**: Mandatory user table structure for Replit Auth compatibility

### 2. Database Schema (Drizzle ORM)
- **Users**: Basic user profile and Stripe integration
- **Accounts**: Company settings and QuickBooks tokens
- **Vendors**: Contractor information synced from QuickBooks
- **Documents**: W-9s and COI tracking with status and expiry
- **Reminders**: Automated reminder history
- **Bills**: Payment tracking for discount opportunities
- **Timeline Events**: Activity feed for real-time updates

### 3. External Service Integrations
- **QuickBooks Online**: OAuth flow, vendor sync, bill tracking
- **SendGrid**: Email notifications and reminders
- **Twilio**: SMS reminder capabilities
- **Stripe**: Subscription billing and payment processing
- **Replit Object Storage**: Document file storage

### 4. Frontend Architecture
- **React Router**: Wouter for lightweight routing
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui components with Radix primitives
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first Tailwind CSS approach
- **Real-time UI**: SSE integration for live updates

### 5. Background Services
- **Cron Jobs**: Automated QuickBooks sync, reminder scheduling, COI expiry checks
- **Event Bus**: In-memory event system for real-time notifications
- **File Processing**: Multer for document uploads with 10MB limit

## Data Flow

### 1. User Onboarding
1. User signs up via Replit OAuth
2. 4-step wizard: QuickBooks connection → reminder cadence → email templates → test & launch
3. Initial QuickBooks sync pulls vendors and bills
4. System begins monitoring for missing documents

### 2. Document Collection Workflow
1. Cron jobs sync new vendors/bills from QuickBooks every 20 minutes
2. System identifies missing W-9s and COIs
3. Automated reminders sent via email/SMS based on cadence settings
4. Vendors upload documents via secure upload links
5. Real-time notifications update dashboard via SSE

### 3. Risk Management
- COI expiry monitoring with proactive alerts
- Early-payment discount tracking on bills
- Compliance risk scoring based on missing documents
- Timeline events for audit trail

## External Dependencies

### Required Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: Neon PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Session encryption key
- `QBO_CLIENT_ID`, `QBO_CLIENT_SECRET`: QuickBooks OAuth credentials
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `FROM_EMAIL`: Email service configuration
- `TWILIO_*`: SMS service credentials (optional)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`: Payment processing
- `REPLIT_DOMAINS`: Required for Replit OAuth

### Third-party Services
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **QuickBooks Online API**: Vendor and bill data source
- **SendGrid**: Transactional email delivery
- **Twilio**: SMS messaging (optional feature)
- **Stripe**: Subscription billing platform
- **Replit Object Storage**: Document file storage

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- `npm run dev`: Starts development server with TSX for hot reloading
- Vite dev server with HMR for frontend
- Express server with middleware for API routes

### Production Build
- `npm run build`: Vite build for client + esbuild bundle for server
- `npm start`: Runs production server from `dist/` directory
- Database migrations via `npm run db:push` (Drizzle Kit)

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Simplifies development and deployment by keeping client/server code together
2. **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database queries with PostgreSQL dialect
3. **Server-Sent Events**: Chosen over WebSockets for simpler real-time updates
4. **Replit-Native**: Leverages Replit's built-in authentication and services
5. **Background Jobs**: Node-cron for reliable scheduled tasks without external dependencies
6. **File Storage**: Replit Object Storage eliminates need for external S3 setup

The architecture prioritizes rapid development and deployment while maintaining type safety and real-time user experience. The system is designed to handle the critical business workflow of document collection with automated reminders and compliance tracking.
